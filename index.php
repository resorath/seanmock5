              <p>I like software architecture. To me that means:
              <ul>
                <li>How software is designed, by the partnership of developers and artists.</li>
                <li>How software interacts with the person experiencing it.</li>
                <li>How software systems work together, and how data flows through these systems.</li>
              </ul>

          <p>I enjoy a task the most when I get to lead and inspire others who are working with me. This applies to both my 
            leisure and professional activities.</p>

        <h2>My First Day: A Story</h2>

        <div class="payload">
          <p>In 2004, I started playing my then guilty pleasure, Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft. A well known computer game where
            you play as a fantasy character slaying monsters and collecting treasure with thousands of other players. The game was brand new at this time. </p>

            <img src="img/portfolio/wow/gatesopening_800_250.jpg" alt="Onyxia">

            <p>It just so happens that the biggest monsters and greatest treasures exist in special environments called "Raids", challenging environments
              which are instanced off for only your group. 
              Within the first few months of joining a player organization called a guild who did competitive raiding I became a officer within the guild and
              started leading these raids. </p>

              <img src="img/portfolio/wow/ragnaros_800_250.jpg" alt="Onyxia">

            <p>Raids started as 40 player adventures which require significant coordination of talents and precise execution of strategies. 
              For me, the game was more about organizing other players and creating these strategies then it was about actually
              slaying the monsters and getting the loot.</p>

              <img src="img/portfolio/wow/onyxia_800_250.jpg" alt="Onyxia">

            <p>After three years of this, my guild was the top 3 of over hundreds of similar guilds in the region. Our guild, "Rar" was a hit.</p>

            <img src="img/portfolio/wow/patchwerk_800_250.jpg" alt="Onyxia">

            <p>In 2008 I applied the lessons I learned to another guild, "Uprising" and had similar success. I took more of a lead role for all guild operations, acting as
              the "guild master". This position not only included leading raids, but managing the guild's virtual assets, finance and distribution of resources, resolving interpersonal 
              conflicts, leadership selection, recruitment, and relationships with other guilds. I had a lot of fun in this role. </p>



            <p>I had some visions for what the guild might look like if we were to go back and build from scratch. I called it "Uprising 3.0", and even built a new website for it.
              The image on the right leads to the archived forum of those thoughts. </p>

        <h2>In the Real World...</h2>

        <div class="intro">
          <p>Of course, video games are fun but face-to-face interactions are good experience too.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I held the role of "Team Lead" for the Applications Development, Development Services group in the University of Calgary's 
              Information Technologies department. This role was a mixed bag of project management and software development leadership. </li>
            <li>Every year, I run a day-long session for teen girls with an objective to get the next generation interested in IT. 
              My session allows the girls to make their own little video game using Alice. This is always a lot of fun for everyone involved, including myself. The program
              is run by Explore IT. </li>
